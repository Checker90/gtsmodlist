The list is in English, but if you know what you’re doing, you can manually add your preferred language back into the stock game folder after installation.<br>
You must also install all translation mods listed on the Nexus page for this Wabbajack list, if you wish to use the collection in another language.<br>
The list includes custom profile folders, each containing pre-made StarfieldCustom.ini settings for every supported language.

**System Requirements**

* [Install Microsoft .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.5-windows-x64-installer)
* [Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015–2019 Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
* Disable OneDrive and any other software that interacts with your Documents folder or redirects user file paths.
(These programs often interfere with MO2 and Starfield configs.)

* You must have the latest version of the game installed.
* Shattered Space DLC is required, the installation cannot complete without it.

**Recommended:**

* 32 GB RAM for optimal performance

* Pagefile set to ~80GB ([see the instructions provided in the guide](https://github.com/Ry-Squid/Gate-To-Stars/blob/main/How%20to%20set%20paging%20file%20size.md))

* A clean Steam installation of Starfield (no previous mods or alterations in the game directory)

**First Launch**

Start the game through Steam one time, go to the main menu, then exit.<br>
After that, you will not launch Starfield through Steam anymore, MO2 will handle it.<br>
